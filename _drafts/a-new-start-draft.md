### Reboot

Starting from scratch is exciting. I am looking forward to learning new
technologies and figuring out new ways of building solid web/mobile applications.

Here is a list of things I'd like to learn and nail.

* Objective-C
* Javascript - Javascript is the new C
* Mongodb
* Production system for the new stack

My goals is to document the learning experiences in this blog so that it would be useful for others who follow the same path.
